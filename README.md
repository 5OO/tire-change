## Tire Change Booking Application - README.md

**Objective**

This project aims to develop an application for booking vehicle tire change appointments. Users can view available tire change slots at partnered workshops, filter them based on their needs, and book appointments for chosen times.

**Functionalities**

* **User Interface:**
    * Users can filter tire change appointments by:
        * Workshop location
        * Date range
        * Vehicle type serviced
    * Users can book available time slots.
    * The application displays a list of available appointments with details including:
        * Workshop name
        * Workshop address
        * Tire change time
        * Vehicle types serviced
    * The application displays appropriate error messages for any encountered issues.
* **Workshop Management:**
    * Tire workshop data (names, addresses, vehicle types) can be easily managed without modifying code, likely through a configuration block.
    * The application is designed to accommodate adding more workshops in the future.
* **Technical Aspects:**
    * Server-side communication with workshop applications handles appointment queries and bookings.
    * The application's server-side is developed using Java technologies. (Use of a popular framework is optional)
    * The project utilizes a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) for version control.

**Evaluation Criteria**

* Adherence to project requirements
* Code style and readability
* User interface design and usability
* Logical structure of the code
* Code coverage with unit tests

**Workshop Information**
